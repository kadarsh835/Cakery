

2 1/4 cups all-purpose unbleached flour

1 teaspoon baking powder

2 teaspoons baking soda

1 teaspoon fine sea salt

1 1/2 tablespoons cinnamon

2 1/4 cups granulated sugar

1 teaspoon nutmeg

1 1/4 cups canola oil

4 large eggs

1 3/4 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

3/4 cup (about 3 to 4) carrots, peeled and shredded

1/2 cup raisins

1/2 cup chopped walnuts

1/2 cup crushed pineapple, drained

Makes 24 cupcakes

 

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray 24 muffin cups with non-stick baking spray or line with papers.

With an electric mixer on low speed mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt cinnamon, sugar and nutmeg. Add the oil and mix thoroughly. Add the eggs and vanilla, stopping once to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. By hand mix in the carrots, raisins, walnuts, and pineapple until thoroughly combined.

Using a spring-loaded scoop or a spoon, fill the muffin cups 2/3s full. Bake for 28 to 30 minutes until a skewer or toothpick inserted comes out clean.

Let cool for 10 minutes and eat warm and plain, or let cool completely and spread with Cream Cheese Frosting. The cupcakes can be stored in a covered container at room temperature for up to 2 days.
