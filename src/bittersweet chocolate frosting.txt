2 1/2 cups heavy cream

6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter cut into pieces

1 vanilla bean

7 ounces dark chocolate (70 to 80 percent cacao)roughly chopped

2 cups light corn syrup, preferably Lyle’s Golden Syrup

2 cups granulated sugar

2 cups Dutch process unsweetened cocoa powder,sifted

In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, and butter. Slit the vanilla bean in half lengthwise, scrape out the seeds and add along with the scraped pods to the cream in the saucepan. Stir over medium heat until everything is melted.

Remove and discard he vanilla bean pod and stir in the chopped chocolate until it’s completely melted. Add the cocoa powder, sugar, salt, and syrup and whisk until the mixture is smooth.
