blueberry-pecan-scone
Since the day we opened in 1995 the blueberry pecan scone has been the bakery’s number one selling product. 
If you’ve not tasted them, you’ll find out why when you bite into the crispy crust and tender interior dotted with plump berries and toasted pecans.

Ingredients:

2/3 cup pecans

7 ounces (1 3/4 sticks) cold unsalted butter

2 3/4 cups all-purpose unbleached flour

1/3 cup plus 2 teaspoon granulated sugar

2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt

1/2 teaspoon baking soda

3/4 cup buttermilk

1/2 cup (3 ounces) fresh or frozen blueberries

MAKES 12 SCONES
 

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line 2 or 3 baking sheets with parchment and coat lightly with non-stick baking spray.

Cut the butter into 1/2-inch pieces and put in the freezer to harden (about 20 minutes).

Roughly chop the pecans and in a small pan toast in the oven for 8 minutes or until golden. Set aside. Increase the oven temperature to 400°F.

In a large bowl stir the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda until combined. Add the frozen butter pieces and using your fingers, 
a fork, or a pastry blender break up the butter until it’s pea-sized and mixed in with the dry ingredients. Stir in the chopped toasted pecans.

Slowly stir in the buttermilk until the dough is a shaggy mass (you want it to be barely combined with visible streaks of flour). Sprinkle the 
blueberries on top of the dough and gently work them in until they’re evenly distributed being careful to not smash them.

Divide the dough and roll into 2-inch balls and place them on the prepared baking sheets 3-inches apart.

Bake the scones for 23 to 25 minutes or until they’re golden brown and crispy on top.

Let cool 10 minutes before removing them from the pans. Store at room temperature in a covered container for up to 2 days. The scones can be 
reheated in a 300°F oven before serving.
