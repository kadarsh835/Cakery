Brown butter is one of those magical ingredients that adds a warm and nutty richness to baked goods that’s hard to get any other way. You can replace the blueberries with any other berry you like.

Brown Butter Blueberry Muffins
Ingredients:

10 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter

2 large eggs1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons buttermilk

2 large egg yolks

1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

1 vanilla bean

3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose unbleached flour

3/4 cup cake flour

1 1/2 cup granulated sugar

1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon baking powder

2 teaspoons fine sea salt

1 3/4 cups blueberries (fresh or frozen)

Makes 12 muffins

Preheat the oven to 375*F

To make the brown butter, put the butter in a medium heavy saucepan and melt it over medium heat. After the foam subsides, let the butter continue to cook until it turns a pale golden brown. Remove from the heat and set aside for a couple of minutes so it can continue to cook and turn a rich golden brown. Set aside to let the butter cool to room temperature.

In a medium bowl stir the all-purpose flour, cake flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together. Set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk the buttermilk, eggs, yolks, and vanilla extract until combined. Slice the vanilla bean lengthwise and, with the back (dull) edge of a knife, scrape out the seeds and add them to the mixture. Whisk in the cooled brown butter until well combined.

Stir the dry ingredients into the buttermilk/egg mixture until no dry streaks of flour are visible. Sprinkle the blueberries on top and using a spatula fold in until the mixture is just barely blended.

Using a spring-loaded scoop or a spoon, fill the muffin cups 2/3s full. Bake for 25 to 27 minutes or until a rich golden brown. The muffins should be firm but still give a little when you touch the tops.

Let cool for 10 minutes and eat warm or let cool completely and store, covered,  at room temperature for up to 2 days
