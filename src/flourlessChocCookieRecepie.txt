I remember the first Passover I made these cookies and how I couldn’t make enough of them.
 They became an instant favorite because they’re not too sweet and have a deep, rich chocolate flavor. They can be made with different nuts or without them entirely. - Michael Gassen

Ingredients:

3 cups powdered sugar

2/3 cup Dutch process unsweetened cocoa powder

2 tablespoons fine sea salt

5 ounces dark chocolate (58 to 62 percent cacao),

chopped 1 1/2 cup chopped pecans

5 large egg whites

MAKES 25 (3-INCH) COOKIES 
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line 2 or 3 cookie or baking sheets with parchment.

With an electric mixer on low speed, stir the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and salt. Add the chopped chocolate and pecans
 and with the mixer on its lowest speed slowly pour in the egg whites and then mix until just combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and then mix a
 little to make sure it’s well combined.

Transfer the dough to another bowl, cover with plastic and put in the refrigerator for at least 8 to 24 hours to firm up.

Put 2 racks in the upper and lower thirds of the (preheated) oven. Place 1 1/2-inch balls of dough, 2-inches apart on the parchment-lined baking sheets. 
If you have one you can also use a cookie scoop to form the cookies and drop them out onto the sheet pans. (Note: It’s best to bake these cold as they spread quite a bit.
 Scoop and refrigerate the cookies or freeze until you’re ready to bake.) Bake for 13 to 15 minutes. They should have spread out and cracked on top.
 Let cool completely before removing them from the pans. Store in an airtight container for 3 to 4 days.
