				<p style="font-size:18px;">In 1995, as a husband and wife team, Rajat and Nisha Singh set out to recapture a rarity: the neighborhood bakery, where everything was made on premises.
					At the time, a whole generation of customers were purchasing machine-made and not-so-fresh baked goods from supermarkets and coffee shops, the owners said.
					Rajat Singh was a trained baker, while Nisha Singh worked as a managing partner for a restaurant company. 
					Upon leaving college in 1984, Rajat joined his first large-scale bakery, Cake Delights, where he learned how to produce large, consistent quantities of virtually
					every type of baked good. During this time, he discovered his true vocation as a bread baker and went to Nandan Pastry Shop, in Delhi to further his knowledge
					and experience.This assignment provided experience in designing a bakery from the blueprints up, managing staffing and setting up the facility procedures and 
					processes that would serve him
					well in future positions. It was here also, where he met his future wife, Nisha Singh, who was working for Nandan Pastry Shop as a managing partner in the retail
					division.
	
					Upon meeting his commitment to Nandan Pastry Shop, Rajat and Nisha eagerly returned to their hometown -Lucknow. Taking a position as bakery manager at 
					Chestnut in Lucknow,
					Rajat had the opportunity to put his knowledge to the test in a small bakery concept. It was here that he also began making what would become his signature
 					specialty breads. In 1995, Rajat and Nisha decided to take the plunge and open their own neighborhood bakery in "THE CAKERY". It is here that 
 					they realized their passion for revitalizing the neighborhood, artisanal bakery. The Noe Valley Bakery & Bread Company is a full-line bakery serving hand-made
 					breads—with a specialty in fruit breads— pastries, cakes, truffles and cookies. Rajat is an active member of the Bread Bakers Guild of India, Food Runners, and has
 					instructed at the Chestnut, in Mumbai. “We were fortunate to set up shop in the charming little community called 'THE CAKERY'.

					From noon on that first day we opened, all our baked goods were sold out. 25 years later, we still delight many of those same customers and have watched the 
					littlest and most loyal customers become adults. Customers anxiously wait each morning for that hot, fragrant, fresh loaf of bread, handmade muffins, croissants,
 					cookies, or a custom-made birthday cake.” “Because CAKERY is very sophisticated and inventive when it comes to their parties, we have expanded our offerings
 					of cake designs for special occasions." <a href=""> THE BAKING MAGZINE </a>
